# MTools
This library is a collection of modules I use to work with simulation software
(FEniCS, FEAP, etc.). The moudles are tailored to my own needs, so don't expect
a generality as well as a proper documentation.

## Modules

### inp
Library to parse abaqus mesh (input *.inp*) files. General use:
```python

```

### VTKSampler
Module to create a dolfin mesh consistent of hexagonal elements given a *.vtu*
file.
